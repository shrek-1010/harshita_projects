Common triggers include stress, hormonal changes, certain foods (aged cheese, alcohol, caffeine), skipped meals, sleep disruptions, bright lights, strong smells, and weather changes. Genetics play a significant role, as migraines tend to run in families. The exact mechanism involves abnormal brain activity affecting nerve signals, chemicals, and blood vessels. Some people experience "aura" symptoms before a migraine (visual disturbances, numbness). Migraines are more common in women and may change in frequency and severity throughout life.',

Type 1 requires insulin therapy. Type 2 may be managed with lifestyle changes and/or medication. Continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps may help some patients. A team approach involving doctors, diabetes educators, dietitians, and other specialists is often best.',

Additional signs include: sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden severe headache without known cause, sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance/coordination.

            answer: 'Vaccines are among the safest and most effective public health interventions available. They undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before approval, and continued monitoring afterward. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific infectious agents, preventing disease before it occurs. They are important because: 1) They prevent serious, potentially life-threatening diseases, 2) They protect vulnerable populations who cannot be vaccinated, 3) They prevent disease spread in communities (herd immunity), 4) They have eradicated or dramatically reduced many deadly diseases (smallpox, polio, etc.), 5) They are cost-effective compared to treating diseases. Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects, but serious reactions are extremely rare (generally less than one in a million doses). The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks for almost all individuals. Consult with healthcare providers about specific vaccines recommended based on age, health status, and risk factors.',
